# Automatically generate first draft prompt templates

https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-generator

Our prompt generator is compatible with all Claude models, including those with extended thinking capabilities. For prompting tips specific to extended thinking models, see [here](./13.extended-thinking-tips.md).

Sometimes, the hardest part of using an AI model is figuring out how to prompt it effectively. To help with this, we've created a prompt generation tool that guides Claude to generate high-quality prompt templates tailored to your specific tasks. These templates follow many of our prompt engineering best practices.

The prompt generator is particularly useful as a tool for solving the "blank page problem" to give you a jumping-off point for further testing and iteration.

>  Try the prompt generator now directly on the [Console](https://console.anthropic.com/dashboard).

If you're interested in analyzing the underlying prompt and architecture, check out our [prompt generator Google Colab notebook](https://anthropic.com/metaprompt-notebook/). There, you can easily run the code to have Claude construct prompts on your behalf.

Note that to run the Colab notebook, you will need an [API key](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).
