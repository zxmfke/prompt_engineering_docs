# Chain complex prompts for stronger performance

https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/chain-prompts

While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).

When working with complex tasks, Claude can sometimes drop the ball if you try to handle everything in a single prompt. Chain of thought (CoT) prompting is great, but what if your task has multiple distinct steps that each require in-depth thought?

Enter prompt chaining: breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.

## Why chain prompts?

1. **Accuracy**: Each subtask gets Claude's full attention, reducing errors.
2. **Clarity**: Simpler subtasks mean clearer instructions and outputs.
3. **Traceability**: Easily pinpoint and fix issues in your prompt chain.

## When to chain prompts

Use prompt chaining for multi-step tasks like research synthesis, document analysis, or iterative content creation. When a task involves multiple transformations, citations, or instructions, chaining prevents Claude from dropping or mishandling steps.

**Remember:** Each link in the chain gets Claude's full attention!

**Debugging tip**

If Claude misses a step or performs poorly, isolate that step in its own prompt. This lets you fine-tune problematic steps without redoing the entire task.

## How to chain prompts

1. **Identify subtasks**: Break your task into distinct, sequential steps.
2. **Structure with XML for clear handoffs**: Use XML tags to pass outputs between prompts.
3. **Have a single-task goal**: Each subtask should have a single, clear objective.
4. **Iterate**: Refine subtasks based on Claude's performance.

### Example chained workflows:

* **Multi-step analysis**: See the legal and business examples below.
* **Content creation pipelines**: Research → Outline → Draft → Edit → Format.
* **Data processing**: Extract → Transform → Analyze → Visualize.
* **Decision-making**: Gather info → List options → Analyze each → Recommend.
* **Verification loops**: Generate content → Review → Refine → Re-review.

**Optimization tip**

For tasks with independent subtasks (like analyzing multiple docs), create separate prompts and run them in parallel for speed.

### Advanced: Self-correction chains

You can chain prompts to have Claude review its own work! This catches errors and refines outputs, especially for high-stakes tasks.

| Assistant | Methodology: Double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 500 Type 2 diabetes patients. Group A (n=250) received a novel glucagon-like peptide-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GLP-1/GIP) dual agonist; Group B (n=250) received a standard GLP-1 agonist. The 24-week trial’s primary endpoint was HbA1c reduction. Groups were well-matched for age, BMI, and baseline HbA1c.  Findings: - Group A: 1.8% mean HbA1c reduction - Group B: 1.1% mean HbA1c reduction - 68% of Group A vs. 52% of Group B achieved HbA1c <7% - Group A: 5.2kg mean weight loss - Group B: 3.1kg mean weight loss  Secondary endpoints showed improvements in blood pressure and lipid profiles for both groups, with Group A showing slightly better results.  Safety: Similar adverse event profiles, with no serious events attributed to either treatment.  Clinical Implications: The dual GLP-1/GIP agonist demonstrates superior glycemic control and weight loss compared to standard GLP-1 therapy. These results suggest it could be a significant advancement, particularly for obese diabetics. However, longer-term studies are needed to confirm sustained efficacy and safety, as well as to investigate potential benefits on cardiovascular outcomes. |

| Assistant {{STRATEGY_DOC}} | # Multitenancy Strategy Review: SaaS Enterprise Product  ## Executive Summary The proposed strategy demonstrates a solid foundation in scalability and security principles but has gaps in implementation details. It excels in data isolation and component-level scaling but lacks robust app-tier scaling and advanced security measures. Cost optimizations are present but may falter at high scale. With targeted enhancements, this strategy can effectively support our enterprise SaaS ambitions.  ## Detailed Analysis  ### 1. Scalability: B+  Strengths: - Database sharding by tenant is excellent. It minimizes query latency, supports high data growth, and facilitates seamless per-tenant scaling. - Microservices architecture allows scaling individual components based on demand, crucial for handling diverse enterprise workloads.  Weaknesses: - Shared application servers risk becoming a bottleneck. As tenant count and traffic grow, these could degrade performance across all tenants. - Absence of auto-scaling and load balancing for the app tier is a critical oversight. These are essential for handling traffic spikes without over-provisioning.  ### 2. Security: B-  Strengths: - Sharded databases provide strong tenant data isolation, mitigating risks of data leaks or unauthorized access between tenants. - JWT with short expiry and refresh tokens align with OWASP best practices, reducing token vulnerability windows.  Weaknesses: - No mention of data encryption at rest or in transit (TLS 1.3). This is non-negotiable for enterprise data. - Key management strategy is missing. How are encryption keys, JWT secrets, and DB credentials managed and rotated? - IAM lacks depth. We need RBAC with well-defined roles, attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained permissions, and integration with enterprise identity providers (SAML, OIDC).  ### 3. Cost-effectiveness: B  Strengths: - Shared app servers reduce idle capacity costs, good for steady-state traffic. - Serverless for infrequent tasks (e.g., reporting) is smart; pay only when these resources are used.  Weaknesses: - Per-tenant databases may not be cost-effective at scale compared to a well-designed multi-tenant database with robust data partitioning. - No mention of cost-saving measures like reserved instances for predictable workloads or spot instances for fault-tolerant tasks. - Lack of app-tier auto-scaling could lead to over-provisioning, increasing costs.  ## Recommendations  1. **App Tier Resilience**: Implement auto-scaling with Kubernetes or cloud-native services (EKS, GKE). Deploy across availability zones with a CDN for static assets.  2. **Security Hardening**: a. Encrypt data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3). b. Use a managed KMS (AWS KMS, GCP KMS) for key management. c. Enhance IAM with RBAC, ABAC, and SAML/OIDC for enterprise SSO.  3. **Cost Optimization**: a. Evaluate columnar multi-tenant DB (e.g., Snowflake) vs. sharding at scale. b. Use reserved instances for app servers, spot instances for non-critical workloads. c. Implement proactive monitoring and right-sizing to avoid overprovisioning.  4. **Proof of Concept (PoC)**: Before full implementation, conduct a PoC with a high-scale simulation: a. Test sharded DB vs. optimized multi-tenant DB for cost and performance. b. Stress-test app tier with simulated enterprise-level traffic spikes. c. Conduct third-party security audit, focusing on data isolation and access controls.  With these enhancements, our multi-tenancy strategy will be enterprise-grade: scalable, secure, and cost-effective. The PoC will validate our design choices and instill confidence in our enterprise clients. |

| Assistant | 1. Clarity: A + Clear structure with Executive Summary, Detailed Analysis, and Recommendations. + Analysis uses a grading system (B+, B-) for quick grasp of strengths/weaknesses. + Technical terms (RBAC, ABAC, TLS) are explained or contextualized, aiding non-technical leadership. + Visual aids (bullet points, indentation) enhance readability.  2. Actionability: A- + Recommendations are specific and technical (e.g., “Implement auto-scaling with Kubernetes”). + PoC plan with clear objectives provides a roadmap. + Missing: Timelines, resource requirements, or team assignments for each recommendation. + Consider: Add a “Next Steps” section with immediate actions, roles, and a high-level timeline.  3. Enterprise Alignment: A+ + Directly addresses enterprise priorities: - Scalability: Discusses handling enterprise-level traffic spikes. - Security: Focuses on data isolation, encryption, and enterprise IAM. - Cost: Strategies align with enterprise FinOps (reserved instances, right-sizing). + PoC with “high-scale simulation” and security audit shows commitment to enterprise-grade quality. + Language resonates with enterprise concerns: “unacceptable risk,” “enterprise-grade,” “instill confidence.”  Overall, the document excels in clarity and enterprise alignment. The actionability is strong but could be elevated to A+ with a “Next Steps” section. The technical depth, coupled with clear explanations, makes this highly effective for both technical and non-technical leadership. Great work! |
