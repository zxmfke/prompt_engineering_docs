## Prompt Engineering Docs

This repository primarily collects prompt engineering documentation from major vendors, with both Chinese and English versions available. Many large model vendors have impressive performance but do not provide practical guides or learning materials for prompt engineering.

Currently Collected:

- claude: [docs](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview)
- openai: [docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompting)
- grok: [docs](https://docs.x.ai/docs/guides/grok-code-prompt-engineering)
- gemini: [docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting-strategies)
- GLM: [docs](https://docs.bigmodel.cn/cn/guide/platform/prompt)
- kimi: [docs](https://platform.moonshot.cn/docs/guide/prompt-best-practice#%E5%90%91%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B%E6%8F%90%E4%BE%9B%E8%BE%93%E5%87%BA%E7%A4%BA%E4%BE%8B)

Only official documentation is included, and it will be updated as new versions are released. Additionally, this repository will include some of my own interpretations based on the documents, as well as personal practices in the future.
