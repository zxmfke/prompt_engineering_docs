### What is a prompt and why does it matter?

A prompt is the question or instruction you type or share with ChatGPT to start a conversation or get a response. It is usually text, but it can also be an image, audio, or even sharing a file. ChatGPT is powered by a series of Large Language Models (LLMs), which are AI systems trained on massive amounts of data to predict and generate human-like responses. Because LLMs do not "know" things in the way people do, how you phrase your prompt plays a big role in shaping the response. Your prompt guides the model so it can generate a helpful reply.

With GPT-5, prompting has evolved further. The model is significantly better at reasoning through complex instructions and handling longer, multi-step prompts. This means you can consolidate context and related instructions into one request, rather than fragmenting them into many smaller prompts, while still getting coherent and useful outputs.

#### **Prompt engineering**

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining your input in a way that helps ChatGPT give the best possible answer. It’s about figuring out how to ask so you get the result you want, whether that’s a clear summary, comprehensive report, or detailed analysis.

#### **Getting started with prompting**

ChatGPT works best when you give it clear instructions. A good prompt helps the model understand what you need so it can give you helpful, accurate answers. With GPT-5, you can also rely on stronger reasoning and iterative refinement—if the first answer isn’t quite right, clarify or adjust mid-conversation rather than starting over. 

**There’s no single “perfect” way to prompt.** Think of it as a simple conversation with a colleague. Experimentation and iteration are the best ways to discover how AI can be most useful to you.

##### **Simple steps for writing a good prompt**

1. **Outline the** **task** Be clear about what you need ChatGPT to do. Outline what you want, who it’s for, and why it matters.  **→** ***Example*****:** ***Summarize last quarter’s sales results and suggest marketing strategies for next quarter******.***

1. **Give** **helpful context** Add any background (or documentation) that will help. Note that GPT‑5 improves with your company docs and [connectors](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11487775-connectors-in-chatgpt) (ex Teams, SharePoint, Outlook). 

 **→** ***Example*****:** ***Use data from our Q2 sales report.***

1. **Describe your** **ideal output**  Tell ChatGPT how you’d like the response. Even though GPT-5 understands implicit context more effectively, specifying role, audience, or format produces the most accurate and relevant results.

 **→** ***Example*****:** ***Write it as a formal executive summary.***

#### **Sample prompts**

The below are examples. Open [ChatGPT ](http://chatgpt.com)and adapt a prompt for your role. ome examples now demonstrate GPT-5’s ability to produce structured formats or handle multi-step reasoning.

##### **Product launch brief (**[**try it in ChatGPT**](https://chatgpt.com/?model=o4-mini-high&prompt=Draft a two-paragraph announcement email for our upcoming product launch using the feature list and positioning notes in the attached launch brief.

##### *Draft a two-paragraph announcement email for our upcoming product launch* *using the feature list and positioning notes in the attached launch brief.* *Format the email with a short subject line, an engaging opening sentence, and a clear call to action.*

##### **Policy snapshot (**[**try it in ChatGPT**](https://chatgpt.com/?model=o4-mini-high&prompt=Create a one-page overview of our updated parental-leave policy for employees%2C based on the policy document linked below and highlight any changes from the 2023 version. Present the overview in plain language with section headings and bullet points.))

##### *Create a one-page overview of our updated parental-leave policy for employees,* *based on the policy document linked below and highlight any changes from the 2023 version.* *Present the overview in plain language with section headings and bullet points.*

### **Sprint Retrospective Summary (**[**try it in ChatGPT**](https://chatgpt.com/?model=o4-mini-high&prompt=Summarize the key takeaways from this week’s sprint retrospective from the attached meeting transcript and suggest two process improvements. Deliver the summary as numbered action items followed by a short paragraph explaining the impact of each.)**)**

##### *Summarize the key takeaways from this week’s sprint retrospective* *f**rom the attached meeting transcript* *and suggest two process improvements. Deliver the summary as numbered action items followed by a short paragraph explaining the impact of each.*



#### **More helpful tips** 

**Break big tasks into smaller steps** If your request has lots of parts, try splitting it up. This makes it easier for ChatGPT to give clear, focused answers.

**Be specific, but keep it simple** The more detail you give, the better the response, but focus on what really matters. Too much extra information can sometimes make the answer less helpful.

**Ask for options** If you want choices, just say so. *Example: “Suggest two different ways to present this report.”*

**Set priorities** Let ChatGPT know what is most important to you, for example accuracy, creativity, speed or something else. If you want it to think more deeply before responding, explicitly ask for deeper reasoning (e.g., “think deeper,” “think hard,” “think more,” “think carefully,”) to trigger higher-effort solutions.

**Guide the tone and format** Tell ChatGPT how you want the response to sound and look. GPT-5 can also produce structured outputs like tables, outlines, or JSON if you specify.
